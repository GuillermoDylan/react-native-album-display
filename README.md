# react-native-album-display
This is a React Native component to display information about a music album.

*Take in mind this package is designed to be used for Mobile development (eg: using expo)*

It allows displaying the components on a grid or on a list using the following component:

```JS
var listView = true; // This would display it as a list
<CoverGroup albums={albums} isListView={listView} />

var listView = false; // This would display it as a listgrid
<CoverGroup albums={albums} isListView={listView} />
```

- **coverUrl**: The Album cover as a URL or path to the image
